## Description

WordPress Popular Posts (from now on, just *WPP*) is a highly customizable [plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/) to showcase the most commented / viewed entries on your [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) powered site.


## Features

* **Multi-widget capable**. That is, you can have several widgets of WordPress Popular Posts on your blog - each with its own settings!
* **Time Range** - list those posts of your blog that have been the most popular ones within a specific time range (eg. last 24 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)!
* **WPML support**.
* **WordPress Multiuser support**.
* **Custom Post-type support**. Wanna show other stuff than just posts and pages?
* Display a **thumbnail** of your popular posts! (see [technical requirements](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#im-unable-to-activate-the-display-post-thumbnail-option-why)).
* Use **your own layout**! [Control how your most popular posts are shown on your theme](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-can-i-use-my-own-html-markup-with-your-plugin).
* Check the **statistics** on your most popular posts from wp-admin.
* Order your popular list by comments, views (default) or average views per day!
* **Shortcode support** - use the `[wpp]` shortcode to showcase your most popular posts on pages, too! (see "[Using WPP on posts & pages](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-&-pages)").
* **Template tags** - Don't feel like using widgets? No problem! You can still embed your most popular entries on your theme using the `wpp_get_mostpopular()` template tag. Additionally, the `wpp_gets_views()` template tag allows you to retrieve the views count for a particular post. For usage and instructions, please refer to the [Template tags page](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags).
* **Localizable** to your own language (See [here](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#i-want-to-translate-your-plugin-into-my-language--help-you-update-a-translation-what-do-i-need-to-do) for more info).
* **[WP-PostRatings](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-postratings/) support**. Show your visitors how your readers are rating your posts!


## Requirements

* WordPress 3.8 or above.
* PHP 5.2+ or above.
* Either the [ImageMagik](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.imagick.php) or [GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php) library installed and enabled on your server (not really required, but needed to create thumbnails).


## Installation

1. [Download the plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/) and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `wordpress-popular-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate **WordPress Popular Posts** plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. In your admin console, go to Appeareance > Widgets, drag the WordPress Popular Posts widget to wherever you want it to be and click on Save.
5. (optional) Go to Appeareance > Editor. On "Theme Files", click on `header.php` and make sure that the `<?php wp_head(); ?>` tag is present (should be right before the closing `</head>` tag).


## Usage

WPP can be used as a [WordPress Widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets), which means you can place it on any of your theme's sidebars (and it even supports multiple instances!). However, you can also embed it directly in posts / pages via [shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-&-pages); or anywhere on your theme using the [wpp_get_mostpopular()](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular) template tag.

... and there's even more on the **[Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki)** section, so make sure to stop by!
