WordPress Popular Posts is a highly customizable widget that displays the most popular posts on your blog.

== Description ==

WordPress Popular Posts is a highly customizable widget that displays the most popular posts on your blog.

= Main Features =
* **Multi-widget capable**. That is, you can have several widgets of WordPress Popular Posts on your blog - each with its own settings!
* **Time Range** - list those posts of your blog that have been the most popular ones within a specific time range (eg. last 24 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)!
* **Custom Post-type support**. Wanna show other stuff than just posts and pages?
* Display a **thumbnail** of your posts! (*see the [FAQ section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/faq/) for technical requirements*).
* Use **your own layout**! Control how your most popular posts are shown on your theme.
* **WPML** support!
* Experimental WordPress Multisite support!

= Other Features =
* Check the **statistics** on your most popular posts from wp-admin.
* Order your popular list by comments, views (default) or average views per day!
* **Shortcode support** - use the [wpp] shortcode to showcase your most popular posts on pages, too! For usage and instructions, please refer to the [installation section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/installation/).
* **Template tags** - Don't feel like using widgets? No problem! You can still embed your most popular entries on your theme using the *wpp_get_mostpopular()* template tag. Additionally, the *wpp_gets_views()* template tag allows you to retrieve the views count for a particular post. For usage and instructions, please refer to the [installation section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/installation/).
* **Localizable** to your own language (*See the [FAQ section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/faq/) for more info*).
* **[WP-PostRatings](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-postratings/) support**. Show your visitors how your readers are rating your posts!

= Notices =
* Starting version 3.0.0, the way plugin tracks views count switched back to [AJAX](http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX). The reason for this change is to prevent bots / spiders from inflating views count, so if you're using a caching plugin you should clear its cache after installing / upgrading the WordPress Popular Posts plugin so it can track your posts and pages normally.

**WordPress Popular Posts** is now also on [GitHub](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts)!

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `wordpress-popular-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate **WordPress Popular Posts** plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. In your admin console, go to Appeareance > Widgets, drag the WordPress Popular Posts widget to wherever you want it to be and click on Save.
5. (optional) Go to Appeareance > Editor. On "Theme Files", click on `header.php` and make sure that the `<?php wp_head(); ?>` tag is present (should be right before the closing `</head>` tag).

That's it!

= USAGE =

WPP can be used as a [WordPress Widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets), which means you can place it on any of your theme's sidebars (and it even supports multiple instances!). However, you can also embed it directly in posts / pages via [shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-&-pages); or anywhere on your theme using the [wpp_get_mostpopular()](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular) template tag.

... and there's even more on the **[Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki)**, so make sure to stop by!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### I need help with your plugin! What should I do?
First thing to do is read all the online documentation available ([Installation](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/installation/), [Usage](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts#usage), [Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki), and of course this section) as they should address most of the questions you might have about this plugin (and even more info can be found via *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > FAQ*).

If you're having problems with WPP, my first suggestion would be try disabling all other plugins and then re-enable each one to make sure there are no conflicts. Also, try switching to a different theme and see if the issue persists. Checking the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-popular-posts) and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/issues) is also a good idea as chances are that someone else has already posted something about it. **Remember:** *read first*. It'll save you (and me) time.

= -FUNCTIONALITY- =

= Why WordPress Popular Posts? =
The idea of creating this plugin came from the need to know how many people were actually reading each post. Unfortunately, WordPress doesn't keep views count of your posts anywhere. Because of that, and since I didn't find anything that would suit my needs, I ended up creating WordPress Popular Posts: a highly customizable, easy-to-use WordPress plugin with the ability to keep track of what's popular to showcase it to the visitors!

= How does the plugin count views / calculate the popularity of posts? =
Since WordPress doesn't store views count (only comments count), this plugin stores that info for you. When you sort your popular posts by *views*, WordPress Popular Posts will retrieve the views count it started caching from the time you first installed this plugin, and then rank the top posts according to the settings you have configured in the plugin. WordPress Popular Posts can also rank the popularity of your posts based on comments count as well.

= I'm getting "Sorry. No data so far". What's up with that? =
There are a number of reasons that might explain why you are seeing this message: no one has seen or commented on your posts/pages since WordPress Popular Posts activation, you should give it some time; your current theme does not have the [wp_head()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks) tag in its &lt;head&gt; section, required by my plugin to keep track of what your visitors are viewing on your site; WordPress Popular Posts was unable to create the necessary DB tables to work, make sure your hosting has granted you permission to create / update / modify tables in the database; if you're using a caching plugin -such as W3 Total Cache- you need to clear its cache once right after installing/upgrading this plugin.

= My current theme does not support widgets (booooo!). Can I show my most popular posts in any other way? =
Yes, there are other choices: you can use the [wpp shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-&-pages), which allows you to embed your popular listing directly in the content of your posts and/or pages; or you can use the [wpp_get_mostpopular() template tag](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular). Both options are highly customizable via parameters, check them out via *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Parameters*.

= WordPress Popular Posts is not counting my own visits, why? =
By default, WordPress Popular Posts won't count views generated by logged in users. If your blog requires readers to be logged in to access its contents (or just want WPP to count your own views) please go to *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools* and set *Log views from* to *Everyone*.

= I'm unable to activate the "Display post thumbnail" option. Why? =
Please check that either the [ImageMagick](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.imagick.php) or [GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php) extension is installed and [enabled by your host](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/289778#post-1366038).

= How does WordPress Popular Posts pick my posts' thumbnails? =
WordPress Popular Posts has three different thumbnail options to choose from available at *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools*: *Featured Image* (default), *First image on post*, or [*custom field*](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields). If no images are found, a default thumbnail will be displayed instead.

= I'm seeing a "No thumbnail" image, where's my post thumbnail? =
Make sure you have assigned one to your posts (see previous question).

= Is there any way I can change that ugly "No thumbnail" image for one of my own? =
Fortunately, yes. Go to *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools* and check under *Thumbnail source*. Ideally, the thumbnail you're going to use should be set already with your desired width and height - however, the uploader will give you other size options as configured by your current theme.

= Where can I find the list of parameters accepted by the wpp_get_mostpopular() template tag / [wpp] shortcode? =
You can find it via *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Parameters*.

= I want to have a popular list of my custom post type. How can I do that? =
Simply add your custom post type to the Post Type field in the widget (or if you're using the template tag / shortcode, use the *post_type* parameter).

= How can I use my own HTML markup with your plugin? =
If you're using the widget, simply activate the *Use custom HTML markup* option and set your desired configuration and *Content Tags* (see *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > FAQ* for more); or if you're using the template tag / shortcode, use the *wpp_start*, *wpp_end* and *post_html* parameters (see *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Parameters* for more).

A more advanced way to customize the HTML markup is via [WordPress filters](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/the-beginners-guide-to-wordpress-actions-and-filters--wp-27373 "The Beginner's guide to WordPress actions and filters") by hooking into *wpp_custom_html* or *wpp_post*. For details, please check the [Filters page](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/Filters) on the Wiki.

= I would like to clear all data gathered by WordPress Popular Posts and start over. How can I do that? =
If you go to *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools*, you'll find two buttons that should do what you need: **Clear cache** and **Clear all data**. The first one just wipes out what's in cache (Last 24 hours, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, etc.), keeping the historical data (All-time) intact. The latter wipes out everything from WordPress Popular Posts data tables - even the historical data. Note that **this cannot be undone** so proceed with caution.

= Can WordPress Popular Posts run on WordPress Multisite? =
Starting from version 3.0.0, WPP checks for WordPress Multisite. While I have not tested it, WPP should work just fine under WPMU (but if it doesn't, please let me know).

= -CSS AND STYLESHEETS- =

= Does your plugin include any CSS stylesheets? =
Yes, *but* there are no predefined styles (well, almost). WordPress Popular Posts will first look into your current theme's folder for the wpp.css file and use it if found so that any custom CSS styles made by you are not overwritten, otherwise will use the one bundled with the plugin.

= Each time WordPress Popular Posts is updated the wpp.css stylesheet gets reset and I lose all changes I made to it. How can I keep my custom CSS? =
Copy your modified wpp.css file to your theme's folder, otherwise my plugin will use the one bundled with it by default.

= How can I style my list to look like [insert your desired look here]? =
Since this plugin does not include any predefined designs, it's up to you to style your most popular posts list as you like (you might need to hire someone for this if you don't know HTML/CSS, though). However, I've gathered a few [examples](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list) that should get you started.

= I want to remove WPP's stylesheet. How can I do that? =
You can disable the stylesheet via *wp-admin > Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools*.

= -OTHER STUFF THAT YOU (PROBABLY) WANT TO KNOW- =

= Does WordPress Popular Posts support other languages than english? =
Yes, check the [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/other_notes/) section for more information.

= I want to translate your plugin into my language / help you update a translation. What do I need to do? =
First thing you need to do is get a [gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) editor like [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate all texts into your language. When you're done with it, you'll find several .PO files bundled with the plugin under the *lang* folder. If you're planning to add a new language, go grab *wordpress-popular-posts.po* and rename it to add the proper suffix for your language (eg. wordpress-popular-posts*-es_ES*.po, for Spanish). In any case, open the PO file using Poedit (or your preferred gettext editor) and update the strings there. It sounds complicated, I know, but it's not. Check this handy [guide](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/ "Translating WordPress Plugins & Themes"), in case you get lost at some point. If you're interested in sharing your translation with others (or just helped update a current translation), please [let me know](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-popular-posts).

= I want your plugin to have X or Y functionality. Can it be done? =
If it fits the nature of my plugin and it sounds like something others would like to have, there's a pretty good chance that I will implement it (and if you can provide some sample code with useful comments, much better).

= Your plugin seems to conflict with my current Theme / this other Plugin. Can you please help me? =
If the theme/plugin you're talking about is a free one that can be downloaded from somewhere, sure I can try and take a look into it. Premium themes/plugins are out of discussion though, unless you're willing to grant me access to your site (or get me a copy of this theme/plugin) so I can check it out.

= ETA for your next release? =
Updates will come depending on my work projects (I'm a full-time web developer) and the amount of time I have on my hands. Quick releases will happen only when/if critical bugs are spotted.

= I posted a question at the Support Forum and got no answer from the developer. Why is that? =
Chances are that your question has been already answered either at the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-popular-posts), the [Installation section](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/installation/), the [Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki) or even here in the FAQ section, so I've decided not to answer. It could also happen that I'm just busy at the moment and haven't been able to read your post yet, so please be patient.

= Is there any other way to contact you? =
For the time being, the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-popular-posts) is the only way to contact me. Please do not use my email to get in touch with me *unless I authorize you to do so*.
